***
Data used from [The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/) includes information on terrorist events from 1970 through 2016.

"The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as transnational and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 170,000 cases. For each GTD incident, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and--when identifiable--the group or individual responsible."
